# Running this repo
- `git clone` this repo.
- `yarn` to grab the necessary modules.
- `yarn start` to start the local development.

This should load the page automatically in your browser. If for whatever reason that doesn't work, you should be able to load the page by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes:

- I used Node version `v16.0.0` to install these modules. Most likely any older version of Node should work. But if it doesn't I can also deploy this repo on Netlify for you to check. Please notify me if this repo doesn't work for you.
- This was created using `create-react-app`.
- The `TestWrapper` was created and styled for both desktop and mobile within 8 hours.
- I haven't done the actual test yet and will be starting and completing it within the actual testing time frame.
- The `TestWrapper` is just used to demonstrate my frontend abilities which during most technical interviews is never seen.

Thanks,

Andrew
